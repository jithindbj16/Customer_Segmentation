# Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of modern business strategy. By categorizing customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and demographics, companies can:

- Develop targeted marketing campaigns.
- Enhance customer satisfaction.
- Increase sales and profitability.

In this project, we utilize clustering algorithms to identify unique customer segments from transaction data.
