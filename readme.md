## Introduction

Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of modern business strategy. By categorizing customers into distinct groups based on their behavior and demographics, companies can:

- Develop targeted marketing campaigns.
- Enhance customer satisfaction.
- Increase sales and profitability.

In this project, we utilize clustering algorithms to identify unique customer segments from transaction data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains records of customer transactions, including attributes such as:

- Invoice number
- Stock code
- Description
- Quantity
- Invoice date
- Unit price
- Customer ID
- Country

*Note: Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers before analysis.*

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jithindbj16/Customer_Segmentation.git
   cd Customer_Segmentation
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can run the entire customer segmentation pipeline using the `main.py` script or explore individual steps using the Jupyter notebooks.

**To run the main script:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**To explore individual steps:**

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open and run the notebooks in the following order:**

   - `1_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `2_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
   - `3_customer_segmentation.ipynb`
   - `4_results_visualization.ipynb`

## Results

The analysis leads to the identification of distinct customer segments, each characterized by unique purchasing behaviors. These insights can inform targeted marketing strategies and business decisions.

*Note: Detailed results and visualizations are available in the `4_results_visualization.ipynb` notebook.*
